People are required to stay in the laboratories until the test result comes back. <h4>Quarantine</h4> Regardless of the negative test result, 14 days of quarantine is mandatory for all passengers coming to Guinea.

Emergency flights are exempt from the above travel restrictions. Land borders with Liberia and Guinea are closed until further notice. Essential cargo goods are exempt from this measure. International ports remain operational for freight only. Ferry services to/from Freetown International Airport are suspended although occasional pirogues might still operate on a private basis. Mandatory quarantine for travellers from countries with more than 50 COVID-19 confirmed cases.<br><br>Internal restrictions:<br>A state of emergency is in place until March 2021. All inter-district movement is prohibited indefinitely except for certified essential workers while an indefinite curfew is being observed between 21.00 and 06.00. Essential travellers and workers need to fill in an electronic pass before setting out. The army has been mobilised to enforce restrictions alongside police forces. All events gathering more than 100 people are banned. It is compulsory to wear a face mask when in public spaces. A temporary lockdown was in place from 3-5 May nationwide. All other existing measures, including the ban on inter-district travel, were upheld during this time and remain in place after the lockdown. <h4>Quarantine</h4> Currently quarantine is mandatory for any individuals who meet these requirements: <br><br>All travelers arriving at any point of entry from a country with less than 50 confirmed cases of COVID-19 will be documented. Follow up with these arrivals will continue for a period of 14 days by designated surveillance officers/contact tracers. <br>All travelers arriving at any point of entry from a country with more than 50 confirmed cases of COVID-19, at any point in time, will have to be quarantined for a period of 14 days. <br>The Government of Sierra Leone strongly recommends that individuals planning to visit Sierra Leone from a country with more than 200 confirmed cases of COVID-19 consider deferring their travel plans. If they must travel, they may visit, but will be quarantined as required. <br>All travelers arriving with a Laissez-passer, emergency travel certificate, or ID card will be immediately taken to a quarantine facility for secondary screening. <br>Sierra Leone will review the new quarantine policy regularly and it could change without advance notice based on the epidemiology of the outbreak.  <h4>Sources</h4> [<a href=""https://pandemic.internationalsos.com/2019-ncov/ncov-travel-restrictions-flight-operations-and-screening]"">https://pandemic.internationalsos.com/2019-ncov/ncov-travel-restrictions-flight-operations-and-screening]</a>
